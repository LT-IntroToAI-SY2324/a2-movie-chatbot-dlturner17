3. Make sure you pass all asserts in `a2.py`
4. Complete the reflection problems below

## Reflection Questions
1. What was difficult for you while completing the match function?
Something that was difficult was figuring out how to code the part with the % because I didn't know what to do because I never used percents in java or python.

We could use the match funtion to look for a specific movie
